# PCG-Translations
Translationf or PCG

We want to make the chatbot available in more languages and started this community project to translate it. If you want to help us to translate PCG into your language check out the english file as base and fill in one of the empty files with the translations.

Words in {} are variables. Please do not translate them. The translations have to contain the variables in order for our bot to work. So please make sure to use all the variables in the english base text in the translation as well.

Example English -> Spanish:

"@{USER}'s Buddy: {BUDDY-POKEMON} (lvl {LEVEL}) :eyes: Average IV: {AVERAGE IV}"

->

"@{USER}'s Amigo: {BUDDY-POKEMON} (Lv. {LEVEL}) :eyes: Promedia IV: {AVERAGE IV}"
